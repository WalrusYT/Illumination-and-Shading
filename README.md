# Illumination-and-Shading
Application that allows objects to be viewed under the effect of light sources, using a camera with a perspective projection. The lighting of objects is implemented using the Phong lighting model, evaluated in the camera reference frame. Lighting can be calculated at the level of each fragment (Phong shading) or each vertex (Gouraud shading).
